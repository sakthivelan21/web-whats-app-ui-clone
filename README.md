# WebWhatsAppUiClone

This project was build just for fun to try to implement the web user interface of whatsapp.   

I used component based approach to develop the ui part in angular and no external css library used !!!   

The web user interface is highly responsive to all devices.   

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.6.  

### You can see the User Interface down below

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
